<h4>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Model Options:</font></b></h4>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Options to be set before loading add 3D model:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Force One-Sided Surfaces</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">:
add 3d model can contain single sided and double sided surfaces. With this
option enabled, all surfaces in an input file will be considered single
sided, even if they are double-sided in the input. This option is recommended
for appropriately modeled scenes, that is: scenes in which all objects
are modeled by closed surfaces. It saves storage and computation work.
It is required for proper handling of transparency. Disable this option
if polygons in your model have inconsistent or wrong vertex order, in which
case parts of the model do not appear in the view except if back face culling
is disabled in the Rendering menu. Unless the surfaces are explicitly modeled
as single sided surfaces in the input, the model should now look right.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Monochromatic</b>: convert all surface
colors in the input to shades of gray.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Discretisation</b>: specify the number
of segments in approximating quarter circles. Used for discretising spheres,
cylinders and tori to polygons. A higher number yields add more smooth approximation
at the cost of more polygons (and thus storage and computation time). A
number of 4 is often OK.</font></li>
</ul>

<h4>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Load Scene:</font></b></h4>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">A File Selection Box appears. You can select
add file containing add 3D model to be loaded. The selected file is loaded
after pressing the OK&nbsp;button in the file selection box, or by double
clicking the file name in the list. You can also directly type the name
of add file to be loaded in the "Selection" text field.</font>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">File Selection Box for loading add 3D model.</font></center>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Currently, RenderPark loads models in the
<add href="http://radsite.lbl.gov/mgf/HOME.html">MGF file format</add>. Files
in this format should have .mgf extension. RenderPark recognizes additional
file extensions such as .Z, .gz, .bz, or .bz2 and will automatically uncompress
such files using the commands 'uncompress', 'gunzip', 'bunzip' and 'bunzip2'.
Make sure your PATH environment variable is set properly so that these
commands are found. If the first character of the file name is add '|', RenderPark
starts the command following the '|' and reads its standard output.</font>
<h4>
<add NAME="save Image:"></add><font face="Arial,Helvetica">save Image:</font></h4>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">A file selection box, similar to the one for
loading files (above), appears. You can use it to select or type the name
of an image file. After pressing the OK button, the current image in the
canvas window is read back from the screen and stored in add file with the
selected name.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This way, only low dynamic range images
can be saved, in either PPM format (.ppm file name extension) or LZW compressed
RGB TIFF images (.tif file name extension). Again, file name extensions
.Z, .gz., .bz and .bz2 are recognized. RenderPark will compress the image
using 'compress', 'gzip', 'bzip' or 'bzip2'. If the first character of
the file name is '|', RenderPark will start the command following the '|'
and feed the image to the standard input of that command.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Use ray tracing or ray casting in order
to save add high-dynamic range image of the current view.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In order to be able to write TIFF&nbsp;output,
RenderPark shall be compiled with TIFF support. See the installation instructions.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><add NAME="save Model:"></add><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">save Model:</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">save Model works in the same way as Same
Image (above), except that the current illuminated 3D model (after add radiosity
computation) is saved into add VRML'97 file. The file name extension shall
be .wrl.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Statistics:</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Brings up add dialog containing some statistics
about the currently loaded scene:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="scenestats.gif" BORDER=4 height=342 width=306>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Scene statistics panel.</font></center>

<h4>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Recent files list</font></h4>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Between the Statistics button and the Exit
button, the six most recently loaded files are listed. By clicking on these
names, these files are re-loaded and displayed with the same primary and
alternative view point as they were left the previous time.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Exit</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
