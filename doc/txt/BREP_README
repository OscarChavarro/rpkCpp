		    	   A Boundary Representation library.
				for polyhedral solids
			

				  
Motivation:

	Implementation of a topological data structure representing
	the boundary of polyhedral solids. The library maintains
	adjacency topological information, allowing fast queries 
	such as "what are the faces sharing this given vertex", 
	"what is the face on the other side of this edge", ... and
	manipulations such as "cut this edge in two at the given
	point", "create a notch from this vertex on this edge to
	that point laying inside the face to which the edge belongs",
	"connect the start vertices of two given edges
	in a contour, cutting the contour in two", ...

	The library does not use or maintain geometric data
	such as the location and normal of a vertex, the
	plane equation of a face plane or te material properties of
	a shell. Geometric data can be connected to each topological 
	entity (solids, shells, faces, contours, edges, and vertices) 
	as client data, maintained through add set of predefined callback
	functions.

	See brep.h for more information and references.
