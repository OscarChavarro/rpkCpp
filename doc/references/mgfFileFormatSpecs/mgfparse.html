<A NAME=begin>MGF Parser Library</A>
</H1>
The principal motivation for creating a standard parser library for
MGF is to make it easy for software developers to offer some base
level of compliance.
The key to making MGF easy to support in fact is the parser, which
has the ability to express higher order entities in terms of
lower order ones.
For example, tori are part of the MGF specification, but if a given
program or translator does not support them, the parser will convert
them to cones.
If cones are not supported either, it will convert them further into
smoothed polygons.
If smoothing (vertex normal information) is not supported, it will
be ignored and the program will just get flat polygons.
This is done in such a way that future versions of the standard may
include new entities that old software does not even have to know
about, and they will be converted appropriately.
Forward compatibility is thus built right into the parser loading
mechanism itself -- the programmer simply links to the new code and
the new standard is supported without any further changes.
<P>
<H4>
Language
</H4>
The provided MGF parser is written in ANSI-C.
This language was chosen for reasons of portability and efficiency.
Almost all systems support some form of ANSI-compatible C, and many
languages can cross-link to C libraries without modification.
Backward compatibility to Kernighan and Ritchie C is achieved by
compiling with the -DNOPROTO flag.
<P>
All of the data structures and prototypes needed for the library
are in the header file "parser.h".
This file is the best resource for the parser and is updated with
each MGF release.
<P>
<H4>
Mechanism
</H4>
The parser works by a simple callback mechanism to routines that
actually interpret the individual entities.
Some of these routines will belong to the calling program, and some
will be entity support routines included in the library itself.
There is a global array of function pointers, called
<I>mg_ehand.</I>
It is defined thus:
<P>
<PRE>
extern int	(*mg_ehand[MG_NENTITIES])(int argc, char **argv);
</PRE>
Before parsing begins, this dispatch table is initialized to point to the
routines that will handle each supported entity.
Every entity handler has the same basic prototype, which is the
same as the
<I>main</I>
function, i.e:
<P>
<PRE>
extern int	<I>handler</I>(int argc, char **argv);
</PRE>
The first argument is the number of words in the MGF entity
(counting the entity itself) and the second argument is an array of
nul-terminated strings with the entity and its arguments.
The function should return zero or one of the error
codes defined in "parser.h".
A non-zero return value causes the parser to abort, returning the
error up through its call stack to the entry function, usually
<I>mg_load.</I>
<P>
A special function pointer for undefined entities is
defined as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
extern int	(*mg_uhand)(int argc, char **argv);
</PRE>
By default, this points to the library function
<I>mg_defuhand,</I>
which prints an error message on the first unknown entity and keeps a
count from then on, which is stored in the global unsigned integer
<I>mg_nunknown.</I>
If the
<I>mg_uhand</I>
pointer is assigned a value of NULL instead, parsing will abort at the
first unrecognized entity.
The reason this is not the default action is that ignoring unknown entities
offers a certain base level of forward compatibility.
Ignoring things one does not understand is not the best approach, but it
is usually better than quitting with an error message if the input is
in fact valid, but is a later version of the standard.
The real solution is to update the interpreter by linking to a new version
of the parser, or use a new version of the
<I>mgfilt</I>
command to convert the new MGF input to an older standard.
<P>
The
<I>mg_uhand</I>
pointer may also be used to customize the language for a particular
application by adding entities, though this is discouraged because it
tends to weaken the standard.
<P>
The skeletal framework for an MGF loader or translator is to assign
function pointers to the
<I>mg_ehand</I>
array, call the parser initialization function
<I>mg_init,</I>
then call the file loader function
<I>mg_load</I>
once for each input file.
This will in turn make calls back to the functions assigned to
<I>mg_ehand.</I>
To give a simple example, let us look at a
translator that understands only flat polygonal faces, putting out
vertex locations immediately after each "face" keyword:
<P>
<PRE>
#include &lt stdio.h &gt
#include "parser.h"

int
myfaceh(ac, av)			/* face handling routine */
int	ac;
char	**av;
{
	C_VERTEX	*vp;	/* vertex structure pointer */
	FVECT	vert;		/* vertex point location */
	int	i;

	if (ac &lt 4)			/* check # arguments */
		return(MG_EARGC);
	printf("face\n");		/* begin face output */
	for (i = 1; i &lt ac; i++) {
		if ((vp = c_getvert(av[i])) == NULL)	/* vertex from name */
			return(MG_EUNDEF);
		xf_xfmpoint(vert, vp -&gt p);		/* apply transform */
		printf("%15.9f %15.9f %15.9f\n",
			vert[0], vert[1], vert[2]);	/* output vertex */
	}
	printf(";\n");			/* end of face output */
	return(MG_OK);			/* normal exit */
}

main(argc, argv)		/* translate MGF file(s) */
int	argc;
char	**argv;
{
	int	i;
					/* initialize dispatch table */
	mg_ehand[MG_E_FACE] = myfaceh;		/* ours */
	mg_ehand[MG_E_VERTEX] = c_hvertex;	/* parser lib */
	mg_ehand[MG_E_POINT] = c_hvertex;	/* parser lib */
	mg_ehand[MG_E_XF] = xf_handler;		/* parser lib */
	mg_init();				/* initialize parser */
	for (i = 1; i &lt argc; i++)		/* load each file argument */
		if (mg_load(argv[i]) != MG_OK)	/* and check for error */
			exit(1);
	exit(0);			/* all done! */
}
</PRE>
Hopefully, this example demonstrates just how easy it is to
write an MGF translator.
Of course, translators get more complicated the more entity
types they support, but the point is that one does not
<I>have</I>
to support every entity -- the parser handles what the translator
does not.
Also, the library includes many general entity handlers,
further reducing the burden on the programmer.
This same principle means that it is not necessary to modify an
existing program to accommodate a new version of MGF -- one need only
link to the new parser library to comply with the new standard.

As seen in the previous example, there are two parser routines that
are normally called directly in an MGF translator or loader program.
The first is
<I>mg_init,</I>
which takes no arguments but relies on the program having
initialized those parts of the global
<I>mg_ehand</I>
array it cares about.
The second routine is
<I>mg_load,</I>
which is called once on each input file.
(A third routine,
<I>mg_clear,</I>
may be called to free the parser data structures after each file or
after all files, if the program plans to continue rather than
exit.)
<P>
The rest of the routines in a translator or loader program are
called indirectly through the
<I>mg_ehand</I>
dispatch table, and they are the ones that do the real work of
supporting the MGF entities.
In addition to converting or discarding entities that the calling
program does not know or care about, the parser library includes a
set of context handlers that greatly simplify the translation
process.
There are three handlers for each of the three named contexts and
their constituents, and two handlers for the two hierarchical
context entities.
To use these handlers, one simply sets the appropriate positions in the
<I>mg_ehand</I>
dispatch table to point to these functions.
Additional functions and global data structures provide convenient
access to the relevant contexts, and all of these are detailed in
the following manual pages.
