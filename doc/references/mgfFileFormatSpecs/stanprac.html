<A NAME=begin>Relation to Standard Practices in Computer Graphics</A>
</H2>
For those coming from a computer graphics background, some of the
choices in the material model may seem strange or even capricious.
Why not simply stick with RGB colors and a Phong specular component
like everyone else?
What is the point in choosing the number of sides to a material?
<P>
In the real world, a surface can have only one side,
defining the interface between one volume and another.
Many object-space rendering packages (e.g. z-buffer algorithms) take
advantage of this fact by culling back-facing polygons and thus saving
as much as 50% of the preprocessing time.
However, many models rely on an
approximation whereby a single surface is used to represent a very thin
volume, such as a pane of glass, and this also can provide significant
calculational savings in an image-space algorithm (such as
ray-tracing).
Also, many models are created in such a way that the front vs. back
information is lost or confused, so that the back side of one or
more surfaces may have to serve as the front side during rendering.
(AutoCAD is one easily identified culprit in this department.)
Since both types of surface models are useful and any
rendering algorithm may ultimately be applied, MGF provides a way
to specify sidedness rather than picking one interpretation or the other.
<P>
The problem with RGB is that there is no accepted standard, and even
if we were to set one it would either be impossible to realize (i.e.
impossible to create phosphors with the chosen colors) or it would
have a gamut that excludes many saturated colors.
The CIE color system was very carefully conceived and developed,
and is the standard to which all photometric measurements adhere.
It is therefore the logical choice in any standard format, though it
has been too often ignored by the computer graphics community.
<P>
Regarding Phong shading, this was never a physical model and making it
behave basic laws of reciprocity and energy balance is difficult.
More to the point, specular power has almost nothing to do with
surface microstructure, and is difficult to set properly
even if every physical characteristic of a material has
been carefully measured.
This is the ultimate indictment of any physical model -- that it
is incapable of reproducing any measurement whatsoever.
<P>
Admittedly, the compliment of diffuse and specular component plus
surface roughness and index of refraction used in MGF is less than a
perfect model, but it is serviceable for most materials and
relatively simple to incorporate into a rendering algorithm.
In the long term, MGF shall probably include full spectral
scattering functions, though the sheer quantity of data involved
makes this burdensome from both the measurement side and the
simulation side.
<P>
<H3>
Converting between Phong Specular Power and Gaussian Roughness
</H3>
So-called specular reflection and transmission are modeled using a
Gaussian distribution of surface facets.
The roughness parameters to the
<A HREF="rs.html">rs</A>
and
<A HREF="ts.html">ts</A>
entities specify
the root-mean-squared (RMS) surface facet slope, which varies from 0
for a perfectly smooth surface to around .2 for a fairly rough one.
The effect this will have on the reflected component distribution is
well-defined, but predicting the behavior of the transmitted
component requires further assumptions.
We assume that the surface
scatters light passing through it just as much as it scatters
reflected light.
This assumption is approximately correct for a
two-sided transparent material with an index of refraction of 1.5
(like glass) and both sides having the given RMS facet slope.
<P>
Oftentimes, one is translating from a Phong exponent on the cosine
of the half-vector-to-normal angle to the more physical but less
familiar Gaussian model of MGF.
The hardest part is translating the specular power to a roughness value.
For this, we recommend the following approximation:
<PRE>
	roughness = sqrt(2/specular_power)
</PRE>
It is not a perfect correlation, but it is about as close as one can get.
<P>
<H3>
Converting between RGB and CIE Colors
</H3>
Unlike most graphics languages, MGF does not use an RGB color model,
simply because there is no recognized definition for this model.
It is based on computer monitor phosphors, which vary from one
CRT to the next.
(There is an RGB standard defined in the TV
industry, but this has a rather poor correlation to most computer
monitors and it is impossible to express many real-world colors
within its limited gamut.)
<P>
MGF uses two alternative, well-defined standards, spectral power
distributions and the 1931 CIE 2 degree standard observer.
With the CIE standard, any viewable
color may be exactly represented as an (x,y) chromaticity value.
Unfortunately, the interaction between
colors (i.e. colored light sources and interreflections) cannot be
specified exactly with any finite coordinate set, including CIE
chromaticities.
So, MGF offers the ability to give reflectance,
transmittance or emittance as a function of wavelength over the visible
spectrum.
This function is still discretized, but at a user-selectable
resolution.
Furthermore, spectral colors may be mixed, providing (nearly)
arbitrary basis functions, which can produce more accurate results in
some cases and are merely a convenience for translation in others.
<P>
Conversion back and forth between CIE chromaticity coordinates and spectral
samples is provided within the MGF parser.
Unfortunately, conversion
to and from RGB values depends on a particular RGB definition, and as we
have said, there is no recognized standard.
We therefore recommend that
you decide yourself what chromaticity values to use for each RGB primary,
and adopt the following code to convert between CIE and RGB coordinates.

</PRE>
An alternative to adopting the above code is to use the MGF "cmix"
entity to convert from RGB directly by naming the three primaries in
terms of their chromaticities, e.g:
<P>
<PRE>
c R =
	cxy 0.640 0.330
c G =
	cxy 0.290 0.600
c B =
	cxy 0.150 0.060
</PRE>
<P>
Then, converting from RGB to MGF colors is as simple as multiplying each
component by its relative luminance in a cmix statement, for instance:
<P>
<PRE>
c white =
	cmix 0.265 R 0.670 G 0.065 B
</PRE>
<P>
For the chosen RGB standard, the above specification would result a pure
white.
The reason the coefficients are not all 1 as you might expect is
that cmix uses relative luminance as the standard for its weights.
Since
blue is less luminous for the same energy than red, which is in turn
less luminous than green, the weights cannot be the same to achieve an
even spectral balance.
Unfortunately, computing these relative weights
is not straightforward, though it is given in the above macros as CIE_rf,
CIE_gf and CIE_bf.
(The common factors in these macros may of course
be removed since
<A HREF="cmix.html">cmix</A>
weights are all relative.)
Alternatively, one could measure the actual full scale luminance of
the phosphors with a luminance probe and get the same relative
values.
