DESCRIPTION
</H4>
<I>Mgfilt</I>
takes one or more MGF input files and converts all the entities to
the types listed.
In the first form, a single integer is given for the
<I>version</I>
of MGF that is to be produced.
Since MGF is in its first major release, this is not yet a useful
form, but it will be when the second major release comes out.
This has the necessary side-effect of expanding all included files.
(See the <A HREF="i.html">i</A> entity.)
<P>
In the second form,
<I>mgfilt</I>
produces only the entities listed in the first argument, which must
be comma-separated.
The listed entity order is not important, but all entities given
must be defined in the current version of MGF.
Unknown entities will be summarily discarded on the input, and a
warning message will be printed to the standard error.
<P>
