SYNOPSIS

<B>td</B>
<I>tau_d</I>

DESCRIPTION
</H4>
Set the diffuse transmittance for the current material to
<I>tau_d</I>
using the current color to determine the spectral characteristics.
This is the fraction of visible light that is transmitted through a
surface equally in all (transmitted) directions.
Like reflectance, transmittance is measured according to the
standard v(lambda) curve, and assumes an equal-energy white light source.
It is probably not possible to create a material with a diffuse
transmittance above 50%, since well-diffused light will be reflected
as well.
<P>
The default diffuse transmittance is zero.

EXAMPLE

<PRE>
# Model a perfect spherical diffuser, i.e. light hitting \
	either side will be scattered equally in all directions
m wonderland_diffuser =
	c
	td .5
	rd .5
