<H3><A NAME=1>Ignoring new entities.</A></H3>
If an old version of the MGF parser encounters new entities it does
not recognize, the default action is to ignore them, printing a warning
message.
This may be overridden to support custom entities, but such
practice is discouraged because it weakens the standard.

<H3><A NAME=3>MGF Identifier.</A></H3>
A name in MGF is any sequence of printing, non-white ASCII characters
beginning with a letter.

<H3><A NAME=4>Rendering Polygons with Seams.</A></H3>
For systems that
are sensitive to seam position, it is probably safest for their MGF
loader/translator to re-expresses seams in terms of holes again, which can
be done easily so long as vertices are shared in the fashion shown.
