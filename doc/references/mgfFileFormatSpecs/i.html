NAME

i - include MGF data file

SYNOPSIS
</H4>
<B>i</B>
<I>pathname</I>
[
<I>transform</I>
]
<P>
<H4>
DESCRIPTION
</H4>
Include the information contained in the file
<I>pathname.</I>
If a
<I>transform</I>
specification is given, then it will be applied as though the
include statement were enclosed by beginning and ending
<A HREF="xf.html">xf</A>
entities with this transformation.
<P>
The
<I>pathname</I>
will be interpreted relative to the enclosing MGF file.
That is, if the file containing the include statement is in some
parent or subdirectory, then the given pathname is appended to this
directory.
It is illegal to specify a
<I>pathname</I>
relative to the root directory, and the MGF standard requires that
all filenames adhere to the ISO-9660 8.3 name format for maximum
portability between systems.
The directory separator is defined to be slash ('/'), and drive
specifications (such as "c:") are not allowed.
All pathnames should be given in lower case, and will be converted to
upper case on systems that require it.
(That way, there are no accidental name collisions.)\0
<P>
The suggested suffix for MGF-adherent files is ".mgf".
Files that are not in metric units but are in MGF may be given any
suffix, but we suggest using ".inc" as a convention.
