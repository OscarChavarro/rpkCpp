cxy - set the CIE (x,y) chromaticity for the current color

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
</H4>
This entity sets the current color using (x,y) chromaticity
coordinates for the 1931 CIE standard 2 degree observer.
Legal values for
<I>x</I>
and
<I>y</I>
are greater than zero and sum to less than one, and more
specifically they must fit within the curve of the visible spectrum.
The
<I>x</I>
coordinate roughly corresponds to the red part of the spectrum and
the
<I>y</I>
coordinate corresponds to the green.
The CIE z coordinate is implicit, since it is equal to (1-x-y).
<P>
All colors in MGF are absolute, thus colorimeter measurements should
be conducted the same for surfaces as for light sources.
Applying a standard illuminant calculation is redundant and
introduces inaccuracies, and should therefore be avoided if
possible.
<P>
Conversion between CIE colors and those more commonly used in
computer graphics are described in the application notes section
6.1.1.
