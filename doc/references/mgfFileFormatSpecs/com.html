SYNOPSIS

<H4>
DESCRIPTION
</H4>
A comment is a bit of text explanation.
Since it is an entity like any other (except that it has no effect),
there must be at least one space between the keyword (which is a
pound sign) and the "arguments," and the end of line may be escaped
as usual with the backslash character ('\').
<P>
A comment may actually be used to hold auxiliary information such as
view parameters, which may be interpreted by some destination program.
Care should be taken under such circumstances that the user does not
inadvertently mung or mimic this information in other comments, and
it is therefore advisable to use an additional set of identifying
characters to distinguish such data.
