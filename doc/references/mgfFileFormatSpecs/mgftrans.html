<A NAME=begin>MGF Translators</A>
</H1>
Initially, there are six translators for MGF data, and
three of these are distributed with the MGF parser itself,
<A HREF="mgfilt.html">mgfilt</A>,
<A HREF="mgf2inv.html">mgf2inv</A>
and
<A HREF="3ds2mgf.html">3ds2mgf</A>.
Two of the other translators,
<A HREF="mgf2rad.html">mgf2rad</A>
and
<A HREF="rad2mgf.html">rad2mgf</A>
convert between MGF and the Radiance scene description language,
and are distributed for free with the rest of the
<A HREF="https://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/HOME.html">Radiance package</A>.
The sixth translator,
<A HREF="mgf2meta.html">mgf2meta,</A>
converts to a 2-dimensional line plot, and is also
distributed with Radiance.
<P>
Mgfilt is a simple but useful utility that takes MGF on its input
and produces MGF on its output.
It uses the parser to convert entities that are not wanted or
understood, and produces only the requested ones.
This is useful for seeing what exactly a program must understand
when it supports a given set of entities, and may serve as a
substitute for linking to the parser library for programmers who
wish to interpret the ASCII input directly but without all the
unwanted entities.
In future releases of MGF, this utility will also be handy for
taking new entities and producing older versions of MGF for
translators that have not yet been updated properly.
<P>
Mgf2inv converts from MGF to Inventor or VRML format.
Some information is lost, because these formats do not support
physical light sources or materials.
3ds2mgf converts from 3D Studio binary format to MGF.
Care must be taken to correct for errors in the material descriptions,
since 3D Studio is completely non-physical.
