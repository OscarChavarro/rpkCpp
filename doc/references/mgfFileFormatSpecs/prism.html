prism - create a closed right prism
<P>
<H4>
SYNOPSIS
</H4>
<B>prism</B>
<I>v1 v2 ... vN length</I>
<P>
<H4>
DESCRIPTION
</H4>
Create a closed right prism using the current material.
One end face will be enclosed by the named vertices, and the
opposite end face will be a mirror image at a distance
<I>length</I>
from the original.
The edges will be extruded into N quadrilaterals connecting
the two end faces.
<P>
The order of vertices determines the original face orientation
according to the right-hand rule as explained for the
<A HREF="f.html">f</A>
entity.
Normally, the prism is extruded in the direction opposite to the
original surface normal, resulting in faces that all point outward.
If the specified
<I>length</I>
is negative, the prism will be extruded above the original face
and all surface normals will point inward.
<P>
If the vertices have associated normals, they are applied to the
side faces only, and should generally point in the appropriate
direction (i.e. in or out depending on whether
<I>length</I>
is negative or positive).

<PRE>
# Make a unit cube starting at the origin and \
	extending to the positive octant
v cv0 =
	p 0 0 0
v cv1 =
	p 0 1 0
v cv2 =
	p 1 1 0
v cv3 =
	p 1 0 0
# Right hand rule has original face looking in -Z direction
