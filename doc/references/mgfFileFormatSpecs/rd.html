SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
</H4>
Set the diffuse reflectance for the current material to
<I>rho_d</I>
using the current color to determine the spectral characteristics.
This is the fraction of visible light that is reflected from a
surface equally in all directions according to Lambert's law, and is
often called the "Lambertian component."
Photometric reflectance is measured according to v(lambda)
response function of the 1931 CIE standard 2
degree observer, and assumes an equal-energy white light source.
The value must be between zero and one, and may be further
restricted by the luminosity of the selected color.
(I.e. it is impossible to have a violet material with a photometric
reflectance close to one since the eye is less sensitive in this part
of the spectrum.)
<P>
The default diffuse reflectance is zero.
