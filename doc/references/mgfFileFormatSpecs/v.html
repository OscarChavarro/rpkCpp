DESCRIPTION
</H4>
If the
<A HREF="v.html">v</A>
keyword is given by itself, then it establishes
the unnamed vertex context, which is the origin with no normal.
This context may be modified, but the changes will not be saved.
(The unnamed vertex is never used except as a source of default
values since all geometric entities call their vertices by name.)
<P>
If the keyword is followed by an <A HREF="notes.html#3">identifier</A>
<I>id,</I>
then it reestablishes a previous context.
If the specified context was never defined, an error will result.
<P>
If the entity is given with an identifier
followed by an equals sign ('='), then a new context is established,
and cleared to the default vertex (the origin).
(Note that the equals sign must be separated from other
arguments by white space to be properly recognized.)
If the equals sign is followed by a second identifier
<I>template,</I>
then this previously defined vertex will be used as a source of
default values instead.
This may be used to establish a vertex alias, or to modify an
existing vertex and give it a new name.
<P>
A non-zero vertex normal must be given for
certain entities, specifically
<A HREF="ring.html">ring</A>
and
<A HREF="torus.html">torus</A>
require a normal direction.
An
<A HREF="f.html">f</A>
entity will interpolate vertex normals if given, and
use the polygon plane normal otherwise.
See the
<A HREF="prism.html">prism</A>
entry for an explanation of how it interprets and uses vertex
normals.
The other entities ignore vertex normals if present.
<P>
The actual position and normal direction for a vertex is determined
at the time of use by a geometric entity.
Specifically, the transformation in effect at the time the vertex is
defined is irrelevant.
The only transformation that matters is the one that is applied to
the geometry itself.
This prevents double-transformation of vertices and allows one set
of vertices to be used for multiple purposes, e.g. the front and
back sides of a drawer.
