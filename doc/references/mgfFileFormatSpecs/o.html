o - begin or end object context

SYNOPSIS
</H4>
<B>o</B>
[
<I>name</I>
]
<P>
<H4>
DESCRIPTION
</H4>
If
<I>name</I>
is given, we push a new object context onto the stack, which is to
say that we begin a new subobject by this <A HREF="notes.html#3">name</A>.
If the
<A HREF="o.html">o</A>
keyword is given by itself, then we pop the last object context off
the stack, which means that we leave the current subobject.
<P>
All geometry between the start of an object context and its matching
end statement is associated with the given name.
This may be used in modeling software to help identify objects and
subobjects, or it may be ignored altogether.
<P>
Object begin and end statements should be balanced in a file, and
care should be taken not to overlap transform
(<A HREF="xf.html">xf</A>)
contexts with object contexts, especially when arrays are involved.
This is because the standard parser will assign object contexts to
instanced geometry, which can get confused with other object
contexts if a clear enclosure is not maintained.
