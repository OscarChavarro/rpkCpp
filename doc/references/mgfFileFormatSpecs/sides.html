DESCRIPTION
</H4>
The
<A HREF="sides.html">sides</A>
entity is used to set the number of sides for the current material.
If a surface is two-sided, then it will appear
identical when viewed from either the front or the back.
If a surface is one-sided,
then it appears invisible when viewed from the back side.
This means
that a transmitting object will affect the light coming in through the
front surface and ignore the characteristics of the back surface,
unless the index of refraction is set.
If the index of refraction is set, then the object will act as a
solid piece of dielectric material.
In either case, the transmission properties of the exiting surface
should be the same as the incident surface for the model to be
physically valid.
<P>
The default number of sides is two.
