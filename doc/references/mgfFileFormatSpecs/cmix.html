SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
</H4>
The
<A HREF="cmix.html">cmix</A>
entity sums together two or more named colors using specified
weighting coefficients, which correspond to the relative
photometric brightness of each.
As in all color specifications, the result is normalized so the
absolute scale of the weights does not matter, only their relative 
values.
<P>
If any of the colors is a spectral quantity (i.e. from a
<A HREF="cspec.html">cspec</A>
or
<A HREF="cct.html">cct</A>
entity), then all the colors are first converted to spectral
quantities.
This is done with an approximation for CIE (x,y) chromaticities,
which may be problematic depending on their values.
In general, it is safest to add together colors that are either
all spectral quantities or all CIE quantities.

EXAMPLE

<PRE>
# Define RGB primaries for a standard color monitor
c R =
	cxy 0.640 0.330
c G =
	cxy 0.290 0.600
c B =
	cxy 0.150 0.060
# Mix them together in appropriate amounts for white
c white =
	cmix 0.265 R 0.670 G 0.065 B
