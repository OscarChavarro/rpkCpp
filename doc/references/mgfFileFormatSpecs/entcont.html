An
<I>entity</I>
in MGF is any non-blank line, which must be one of a finite set of
command keywords followed by zero or more arguments.
(As mentioned previously, an entity may continue over multiple lines
by escaping the newline with a backslash.)
Table 1 gives a list of entities and their expected arguments.
Section 3 gives more detailed information on each entity.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Table 1</B>.
MGF entities and their arguments.
Arguments in brackets are optional.
Arguments in curly braces mean one of the given choices must
appear.
Ellipsis (...) mean that any number of arguments may be given.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
A
<I>context</I>
describes the current state of the interpreter, and affects or is
affected by certain entities as they are read in.
MGF contexts can be divided into two types,
<I>hierarchical contexts</I>
and
<I>named contexts</I>.
<P>
Hierarchical contexts are manipulated by a single entity and
have an associated "stack" onto which new
contexts are "pushed" using the entity.
The last context may be "popped" by giving the entity again with no
arguments.
The two hierarchical contexts in MGF are the current transformation,
manipulated with the
<A HREF="xf.html">xf</A>
entity, and the current object, manipulated with the
<A HREF="o.html">o</A>
entity.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Table 2</B>.
MGF contexts and their related entities and default values.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Named contexts in contrast hold sets of values that are swapped
in and out one at a time.
There are three named contexts in MGF, the current material, the
current color and the current vertex.
Each one may be associated with an <A HREF="notes.html#3">identifier</A>,
and one of each is in effect at any given time.
Initially, these contexts are unnamed, and invoking an unnamed
context always returns to the original (default) values.
(See Table 2 for a list of contexts, their related
entities and defaults.)
<P>
It is easiest to think of a context as a "scratch space" where
values are written by some entities and read by others.
Naming a context allows us to reestablish the same scratch space
later, usually for reference but it can be altered as well.
Let us say we wanted to create a smooth blue plastic material with a
diffuse reflectance of 20% and a specular reflectance of 4%:
<P>
<PRE>
# Establish a new material context called "blue_plastic"
m blue_plastic =
	# Reestablish a previous color context called "blue"
	c blue
	# Set the diffuse reflectance, which uses the above color
	rd .20
	# Get the unnamed color context (always starts out grey)
	c
	# Set the specular reflectance, which is uncolored
	rs .04 0
# We're done, the current material context is now "blue_plastic"
</PRE>
Note that the above assumes that we have previously defined a color
context named "blue".
If we forgot to do that, the above description would generate an
"undefined" error.
The color context affects the material context indirectly because it
is read by the specular and diffuse reflectance entities, which are
in turn written to the current material.
It is not necessary to indent the entities that affect the material
definition, but it improves readability.
Note also that there is no explicit end to the material definition.
As long as a context remains in effect, its contents may be altered
by its field entities.
This will not affect previous uses of the context, however.
For example, a surface entity following the above definition will 
have the specified color and reflectance, and later changes to the
material "blue_plastic" will have no effect on it.
<P>
Each of the three named contexts has an associated entity that
controls it.
The material context is controlled by the
<A HREF="m.html">m</A>
entity, the color context is controlled by the
<A HREF="c.html">c</A>
entity, and the vertex context is controlled by the
<A HREF="v.html">v</A>
entity.
There are exactly four forms for each entity.
The first form is the keyword by itself, which establishes
an unnamed context with predetermined default values.
This is a useful way to set values without worrying about saving
them for recall later.
The second form is to give the keyword with a previously defined
name.
This reestablishes a prior context for reuse.
The third form is to give the keyword with a name followed by an
equals sign.
(There must be a space between the name and the equals sign, since
it is a separate argument.)
This establishes a new context and assigns it the same default
values as the unnamed context.
The fourth and final form gives the keyword followed by a name then
an equals then the name of a previous context definition.
This establishes a new context for the first name, assigning the
values from the second named context rather than the usual defaults.
This is a convenient way create an alias or
to modify a context under a new name (i.e. "save as").
